# Installation

**Recommended**: the installation should only take a few minutes:
1. clone this repo
2. install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
3. install the **Lean 4** extension (*warning*: do not confuse it with the *Lean 3*
   extension)
4. open this folder inside of VS Code
5. open the file  `Tutorial/Exercises.lean`
6. wait for Lean to download and build the project dependencies

**If you do not want to use VS Code**, you can directly [install
Lean](https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/setup.html), then run `lake build` and finally open
the file `Tutorial/Exercises.lean`.
